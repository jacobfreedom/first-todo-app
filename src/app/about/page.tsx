      by Jakub as my first CRUD app to learn React. 

      And a project to land a Frontend Developer job with.

      Button - Let me share my story

      I'll make this basic part quick for you.

      Name: Jakub Svoboda

      How I started and what brought me to coding

      I studied IT in highschool and found my first job at a startup at the age of 18 as Marketer - self-taught basics.

      Moved to Prague and switched schools to business highschool with remote possibilities.

      Ever since then I worked for

      Startup Investors, Accelerators, Startups - animated

      Note: I'd like to work on-site for at least 6-12 monnths to learn as quickly as possible, then ideally remote.

      I decided that I want to travel the world, so I moved to Germany for a good offer.

      Worked my way up there to the leadership of a startup. 
      But then reality hit - my jet-setting dreams clashed with the on-site demands of my role.

      I decided to return to Czech and built my own tech startup - that would hopefully allow me to travel, 
      but burnt all my savings on hiring desingers and devs instead.

      At that point I realized that learning to code and landing a gig as a developer was the key to unlocking my dreams.
